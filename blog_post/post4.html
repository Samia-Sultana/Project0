        <h2>Scenic beauty of sea</h3>
        <h4>Elafonissi, Crete</h4>
        <p>The best beach in Greece: Elafonissi on the south coast of Crete. There isn’t much else nearby besides a few small hotels so most people do a day trip from Chania or Rethymnon. Recommended Beach Hotels: Elafonisi Resort by Kalomirakis Family • The wonderful town of Paleochora is a one hour boat ride away. Recommended Paleochora Hotels: Caravella Luxury Apartments (moderate) • Aris Hotel (budget)</p>
        <h4>Mylopotas Beach, Ios</h4>
        <p>Wonderful sand and a quick drop-off for people who like to swim. Stay at either Mylopotas Beach or in the fun main town (Chora) up on the hill (lots of nightlife if you want it, easy to avoid if you don’t). Recommended Hotels: Ios Palace Hotel & Spa (luxury) • Nissos Ios (budget) • Rita’s Place Hotel (budget)

        </p>
        <h4>Plaka Beach, Naxos
        </h4>
        <p>Naxos has many great beaches and if you’re looking for an island with a large variety of beaches it should be at the top of your list. Naxos Town is wonderfully charming and St George beach (a short walk away) is a great town beach. But down the southwest coast there are many others that are even better: Agia Anna, Agios Prokopios, Mikri Vigla, Pyrgaki – and perhaps the best of the lot, Plaka beach. I recommend staying in Naxos Town and taking the frequent buses to the beaches down the coast. Recommended Beach Hotels in Plaka: Iria Beach Hotel • Recommended Beach Hotels in Naxos Town: Nissaki Beach Hotel (luxury) • Naxos Resort Beach Hotel (moderate) • Xenia Hotel (budget)

        </p>
        <h4>Platys Gialos, Mykonos
        </h4>
        <p>he best beach on Mykonos and backed by hotels and restaurants. A fun mellow vibe through the day becomes a romantic/trendy vibe at night. Recommended Beach Hotels in Platys Gialos: Branco Mykonos (luxury, right on the beach) • Petasos Beach Resort & Spa (luxury) • Myconian Ambassador (luxury) • Petinos Beach Hotel (moderate)

        </p>
        <h4>Mytros Beach, Kefalonia
        </h4>
        <p>Myrtos beach on Kefalonia. Recommended Beach Hotels: Odyssey Villas (moderate – great place but you do need a rental car)
