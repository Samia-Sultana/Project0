        <h2>Best sunset points throughout the world</h2>
        <h4>The Taj Mahal, India</h4>
        <p> Regarded as one of the world’s architectural wonders, the Taj Mahal in the Indian state of Agra, transforms into a magical apparition as the day comes to an end and the sun starts to set behind it. The sun’s rays bend and wind round the white marble dome, bathing the stuccoed walls, minarets and garden in a soft pink and orange haze.</p>
       <h4>The Atacama Desert, Chile</h4>
       <p>Chile’s Atacama Desert is so dry that plants find it difficult to sustain life here, and the 2001 film Space Odyssey was shot there, the desert doubling up as the Moon’s arid surface. Small populations cluster round water-filled oases, witness to an incredible sunset each day. Sandboarding and sunset excursions are a popular way for tourists to enjoy the spectacle of the fiery sun sinking over the bone-dry land.</p>
    <h4>TheMatterhorn, Switzerland</h4>
    <p> Rearing 4478 metres skyward, the mighty Matterhorn is the icon of the Swiss Alps, and the sight of the sun setting behind its snow-streaked slopes is truly awe-inspiring. One of the best views is from the futuristic-looking, eco-friendly Monte Rosa hut. The trip there requires plenty of energy and pluck but the views are certainly worth the effort.</p>
     <h4> Punta del Este, Uruguay</h4>
      <p> A chic and fashionable resort town that’s Uruguay’s answer to Europe’s glitzy St Tropez, Punta del Este sits on a peninsula with the rough Atlantic sea on one side and a calmer, sandier estuary strip on the other. After a busy day on the beach, sip a cocktail at one of the seafront bars and watch the large red orb dip below the ocean’s waves.</p>  
    
      <h4>Zanzibar</h4>
    <p> Zanzibar, a beautiful island off the coast of Tanzania, has multiple tropical beaches that are the perfect spots from which to watch the hot African sun disappear. Or hop on a boat and cruise about on the gentle waves, stained blood-red by the setting sun.</p>
        
        
    <h4>Siem Reap, Cambodia</h4>
    <p> You won’t be watching the sun set in peaceful isolation on the top of Siem Reap’s Phnom Bakheng temple, as from around 4pm a large and cheerful crowd begins to gather, waiting for the magical moment when the sun hits the top of Tonlé Sap lake, sparkling and shimmering.</p>
    
   <h4>Isle of Skye, Scotland</h4>
    <p> Quiraing, an oddly shaped landslip on the Isle of Skye’s Trotternish Ridge, is a favourite spot among photographers, who come armed with their lenses to capture the light bouncing off the crags and crevices. As the sun sets, the light show becomes even more captivating.</p>
    
      <h4>Santa Monica, California, USA</h4>
        <p>California’s much-loved playground, Santa Monica Pier boasts rollercoasters, amusement arcades, numerous shops and cafés, a whirling carousel and an aquarium. When the sun begins to go down, head to the beach below the jetty and watch the lights from the amusement park twinkle in the twilight.</p>

       <h4>The Maasai Mara, Kenya</h4>
        <p>   Sunset on safari is a must-see sight, and the Maasai Mara National Reserve in Kenya is one of the most magical places to enjoy it. The sun’s rays begin to cool as it sinks beneath the horizon, immersing the land and wildlife in a rusty orange light.</p>
