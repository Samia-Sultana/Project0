        <h2>World's most colorful places</h2>
        <h4>Capitola, California</h4>
        <p>Surf culture, sunshine, and plenty of pale sand make up the canvas that keeps the bright village and coastal foliage of Capitola so vibrant and vital. Settle in at Margaritaville for a perfect view of the crayon-box buildings set against a dazzling sunset.</p>
        <h4>Procida, Italy</h4>
        <p>Candy-colored buildings nestled closely against the coastline cast their reflections over a gemstone-blue sea. This quintessential Italian island will leave an indelible mark in your memory for both the warmth of its scenes and of its people.</p>
        <h4>Bering Land Bridge, Alaska</h4>
        <p>If a rainbow falls across a remote land and no one is there to see it, does that make it less colorful? The question must be asked at this unpopulated stretch of protected earth. Don’t let nature’s artwork go unnoticed; Bering Land Bridge will wow you with its impressive spectrum of natural wonders</p>
        <h4>Bo-Kaap, Cape Town, South Africa</h4>
        <p>The streets of Bo-Kaap are so awash in electric hues you may need dark sunnies to traverse them. Don’t miss the Nurul Islam Mosque, which is coated a cheerful shade of turquoise.</p>
        <h4>Skagit Valley, Washington</h4>
        <p>Fields of flowers as far as the eye can see give Skagit Valley its unique flair. The neat rows of tulips, daffodils, and irises lend a cheerful air to this stretch of land, which is in full spirit come April, when the Skagit Valley Tulip Festival invites you to witness why some call it the Magic Skagit.</p>
        <h4>Old San Juan, Puerto Rico</h4>
        <p>History is illuminated in this twisty, sun-kissed enclave, where the Spanish colonial buildings have fresh faces of perky paint that are especially colorful against cobblestone streets. It’s no wonder it is considered one of the most beautiful places in the world.</p>
